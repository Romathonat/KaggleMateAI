Customlinkkeyboard_arrow_upHint 1We suggest browsing Dr. Tim Cocx's 'Analysis on the Eurovision Songcontest' available at http://www.liacs.nl/~tcocx/songfestival/indexenglish.html.  It contains an interesting document - a 'Distance matrix' - which represent an abstract (non-geographic) distance that denotes how many points the countries awarded one another in past contests, where a shorter distance implies higher exchanged scores and a larger distance implies fewer exchanged points.  You may consider it worth utilising or producing your own, up-to-date, version based on a similar conceptHint 2One way to approach this competition might be to work out that country A normally allocates country B between 4 and 10 votes (with the precise score depending on the performance's quality). Once you have determined these ranges for all countries, you can use betting market data as a proxy for performance quality. Hint 3If you're thinking about augmenting our dataset, you may be want to try and track down data on expatriate populations in each voting country.Customlinkkeyboard_arrow_upThank you to Stephanie Wayne for putting this competition together.We would also like to thank Betfair Pty Ltd for supplying betting prices dataDescriptionlinkkeyboard_arrow_upThe intrigue of Eurovision - the modeller's delightSince its inauguration in 1956, the Eurovision Song Contest has transfixed millions of viewers worldwide with its bubblegum pop, quirks, ballads and flops.  During its tenure as one of the world's longest-running television programs, it has attracted its fair share of controversy, with claims that the voting outcomes don't simply reflect performance quality but are influenced by factors such as regional politics, expatriate populations, alliances, and artists' sexual appeal.  Patterns have appeared over time which support this hypothesis. Contestants will attempt to exploit these patterns in order to predict the voting for the 2010 Eurovision Song Contest. Down to the detailsWe will provide you with publicly-available data on variables we have deemed potentially important, such as historical voting patterns, betting odds, song details and artist details.  You are welcome to supplement this with any data you believe will improve the accuracy of your model.As the voting method for the Contest has changed over time, we will supply 'Finals' data from 1998 when the current ""televoting"" format was implemented, and 'semi-finals' data from 2004 when semi-finals were introduced.  We will detail Eurovision's voting procedures and their minor changes/exceptions pertinent to the provided data in the 'Data' page of this competition. Your entry will involve submitting a matrix of the individual votes of each voting country for the competitor countries. What is your incentive to enter?There will be a cash prize of USD1000 for the contestant who produces the most accurate predictions. And just as the Contest has launched the high-flying careers of its own performers - notably ABBA and Céline Dion - creating a strong model for this competition will land you a top ranking as a modeler on the Kaggle website.Evaluationlinkkeyboard_arrow_upEvaluation will be performed using the 'Absolute Error' method. A submission's absolute error is calculated by summing the absolute difference between predicted and actual votes.  A low score implies a small deviation of predicted votes from actual votes; a higher score implies a larger difference between predicted votes and actual votes.  The most accurate prediction has the lowest Absolute Error score.  Here is an example of how 'Absolute Error' evaluation works:Predicted voting (submitted by contestant X)                   France      Moldova     NorwayFrance         0              1               1Moldova       2              0               2Norway        1              2               0

Contestant X's Absolute Error score, working row-by-row, would be calculated as follows: Absolute Error(X) = abs(0-0) + abs(1-1) + abs(2-1) + abs(1-2) + abs(0-0) + abs(1-2) + abs(2-1) + abs(2-2) + abs(0-0)                          = 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1+ 0 + 0                          = 4 Prizeslinkkeyboard_arrow_upThe Eurovision Song Contest 2010 forecasting competition will award a prize of US$1000 to the winning entrant.The prize money will only be awarded once the winner has sent a brief description of the methodology employed to generate his/her submission.Ruleslinkkeyboard_arrow_up

Who may enterAnybody who complies with the rules of the challenge Eurovision Song Contest 2010 is welcome to participate.  Only the competition organisers and employees of the European Broadcasting Union are excluded from participating.  Contestants may enter as individuals or as groups, however the subsequent ranking achieved by their model will be allocated to their individual self/group accordingly.  All entrants must identify themselves by registering on Kaggle website, however personal data will only be utilised by the competition organisers and Kaggle in order to communicate with participants.  Submission detailsSubmissions should be made via the 'Make a Submission' page in order to be ranked.  Each contestant may only enter one submission.  If you encounter any problems with the submission process, please contact the Kaggle administrator.Evaluation and prize-givingThe scoring method is detailed on the 'Evaluation' page.  The winner of the Eurovision Song Contest 2010 will only receive the prize money after a brief description of their methodology has been submitted to the competition host.  We may ask other top-ranking participants to voluntarily fill out a form regarding their modelling methods.SubmissionInstructionslinkkeyboard_arrow_upSubmissions must be made using the template attached.The countries listed in column one are the competitors in the Eurovision Song Contest 2010 final. The countries listed in row one are the voting countries. Only 25 of these 39 competing (column one) countries will progress from the semi-finals to the final, however each voting country listed in (row one) will vote in the final.  Your task effectively involves  two steps:1. Firstly you must predict which 25 countries will make it to the final. Keep in mind that Spain, United
Kingdom, France, Germany and Norway are guaranteed final competitors.2. Once you have chosen your 25 finalists you must predict the voting (ie who will vote for who). Make sure you only allocate votes to the 25 countries you predict will make the final. Submissions will only be accepted if each voting country (in row one) has allocated all its votes once to the potential final competitors (in column one), ie: the scores of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12 have been allocated exactly once per voting country.Submissions with scores other than 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10 or 12 will not be accepted.Submissions will only be accepted if votes are allocated to ≤ 25 countries.  Submissions with votes allocated to > 25 countries will not be accepted. Note: all 39 countries vote regardless of whether or not they make the final. Each contestant may only enter with one submission. However, a contestant can delete and replace their submission at any time up until the competition's deadline. As exemplified by the example submission, please ensure that there are no blank cells; instead, where no vote is allocated, enter a '0'.Note: you can open CSV files with Microsoft Excel or OpenOffice for more human-friendly viewing.

1.0,1.0,2435,hivprogression,Predict HIV Progression,"This contest requires competitors to predict the likelihood that an HIV patient's infection will become less severe, given a small dataset and limited clinical information.",Featured,1,,04/27/2010 21:29:09,08/02/2010 12:32:00,,,,,True,True,False,True,30,0.0,MCE,Mean Consequential Error,"Averages consequential error (i.e. if prediction isn't exact, the error is 1, otherwise 0). Only useful when predicting things exactly.",True,4,4,20,False,False,USD,500.0,1,1.0,True,107,116,855,,,False,False,,1,"Backgroundlinkkeyboard_arrow_upThis contest focuses on using the nucleotide sequence of the Reverse Transcriptase (RT) and Protease (PR) to predict the patient's short-term progression. For the non-Biologist: the nucleotide sequence is the blueprint of the protein, which is the workhorse of the cell.  The RT enzyme is responsible for copying the HIV-1 genome within the cell. As the HIV-1 genome is translated it is in one long string of amino acids; the PR protein cuts this string into the numerous functional units - required by the HIV life-cycle. These are the proteins that are targeted by most HIV-1 drugs since they are mostly unique to the HIV-1 life-cycle.  Along with the HIV-1 viral sequences I have provided the two common clinical indicators used to determine the ""general health"" of an HIV-1 infected individual: Viral Load and CD4+ cell counts.  The CD4+ cell count is an estimate of the number of white-blood-cells in 1 mL of blood while the viral load is the number of viral particles in that same mL.  In this dataset the viral load is represented in a log-10 scale.  The higher the number the more ""active"" the immune system. Paradoxically higher CD4 counts imply both a healthier individual but also a higher amount of viral reproduction (the virus primarily replicates in CD4 cells).If you're interested in learning more about the HIV lifecycle and HIV treatments, here are some extra resources:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIVhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RO8MP3wMvqg&feature=relatedhttp://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/HIV/HIVTools.htmlhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV_therapy#TreatmentCustomlinkkeyboard_arrow_upThe previous attempts to find markers in sequence fall into two general camps: alignment and feature extraction.  Alignment methods use multiple sequence alignments to look for mutations which are highly correlated with outcome.  However, the high mutability of the HIV-1 makes this technique difficult ... though not impossible.  Feature extraction methods try to find consistent markers in each sequence; ie. k-mers, regular-expressions, or known resistance conferring mutations.  These are easier to process from a machine-learning point of view but may be difficult to annotate in a large corpus of sequences like this one.Customlinkkeyboard_arrow_upThis competition was organized by William Dampier. You can visit his blog at http://www.willdampier.info/.Descriptionlinkkeyboard_arrow_upAccording to the World Health Organization, HIV has caused 25 millions deaths worldwide since it was first recognized in 1981. In recent years, the infection has been managed with a collection of therapies. However, the virus will likely evolve around these drugs, making it crucially important that we get a better understanding of the virus itself. An important step in understanding the virus, is to get a handle on its genetic blueprint. This competition aims to do this by having contestants find markers in the HIV sequence which predict a change in the severity of the infection (as measured by viral load and CD4 counts).Models can be trained using the records of 1,000 patients. To predict an improvement in a patient's viral load, competitors will be provided with data on the nucleotide sequences of their Reverse Transcriptase (RT) their Protease (PR) and their viral load and CD4 count at the beginning of therapy. There is a brief discussion of the science of these variables in the Background section, but no knowledge of biology is necessary to succeed in this competition. Competitors' predictions will be tested on a dataset containing 692 patients.         There is $USD500 up for grabs, and the winner(s) will also have the opportunity to co-author a paper with the competition host. The winner must supply their methodology before any prize money is awarded. Evaluationlinkkeyboard_arrow_upThe evaluation method is the misclassification error rate, which calculates the number of incorrect predictions as a proportion of the total number of predictions. This means that a contestant is punished equally for a false positive and a false negative prediction.The score quoted on the leaderboard is 1 less the misclassification rate - so the higher the score the better. Also note that the public leaderboard is calculated based on 30 per cent of the submission to prevent contestants from overfitting their models. The full leaderboard will be revealed after the competition deadline passes.   Prizeslinkkeyboard_arrow_upThe winner gets a $USD500 cash prize. If there are multiple winners, the prize is shared between between them. The winner(s) will also have the opportunity to co-author an article with the competition host. SubmissionInstructionslinkkeyboard_arrow_upYour submission must contain predictions for 692 patients. Submissions must be in CSV format. template.csv is a submission template.

We have set up a forecasting competition, allowing competitors to go head-to-head with these corporate giants. The challenge is to correctly predict how far each country will progress in the tournament. There is a small dataset and some links to variables of interest on the data page. There are links to the investment banks' predictions and other World Cup modeling efforts on the hints page.We are running two challenges side-by-side - a Take on the Quants Challenge and a Confidence Challenge. The Take on the Quants Challenge simply requires competitors to pick how far teams will progress in the tournament. Competitors' entries will be ranked against the predictions made by the investment banks. The Confidence Challenge requires competitors to assign a level of confidence to each prediction - a competitor's score is weighted by their level of confidence. Competitors enter both challenges with a single submission. There are more details on the submission instructions page and the evaluation page. The competition closes just before the first game kicks off on June 11th. What is your incentive to enter?The winner of each challenge wins $USD100 to bet on the winner of the FIFA Golden Ball award. However, far more enticing is the opportunity take on some of the best brains at the world's most venerable investment banks. Evaluationlinkkeyboard_arrow_upA single submission enters competitors into two different challenges. 
 
Take on the Quants ChallengeThis challenge allows competitors to take on the investment banks. It requires competitors to pick how far each team will progress through the World Cup. Each competitor has to select one team as the winner, one team as the runner up, one team to finish third, one team to finish fourth, four teams to make it no further than the quarter final etc. A competitor wins points if a selection makes it to the predicted stage or better. E.g. If Italy finishes runner up and a competitor predicted Italy to make it to the quarter final or better, that competitor wins points. A team is less likely to finish runner up or better than to progress to the round of 16 or better, so a correct runner up prediction earns more points. The table below shows the points that competitors earn for correct predictions. 





Winner


32




Runner up or better


16




Third or better


10.67




Fourth or better


8




Quarter final or better


4




Round of 16 or better


2




Third in group or better


1.33




Last in group or better


1




If a competitor predicts that Spain will finish third and they win the tournament, that competitor will receive 10.67 points for that selection. If the competitor picks Brazil to win the tournament and they finish runner up, the competitor receives no points for that selection. If two teams make exactly the same predictions we will use the confidence-weighted score to separate them. The Confidence ChallengeThe results of this challenge are calculated based on a confidence-weighted score. For the confidence-weight score, a correct selection gives a competitor positive points and an incorrect prediction gives a competitor negative points. (The points are as in the table below.) The score a competitor receives from a particular selection is the confidence score multiplied by the points that the selection earns. So for example, if a competitor is 50 per cent confident that Brazil will win, they earn 3.47×0.5=1.73 if Brazil wins, but they lose 3.47×0.5=1.73 points if Brazil loses. If they are 75 per cent confident, they earn 3.47×0.75=2.6 if Brazil wins, and they lose 2.6 points if Brazil loses.

Note: in both challenges if teams earn equal scores, we will give a higher position to the competitor who submitted first (since they submitted when less information was available). Submission Instructionslinkkeyboard_arrow_upSubmission GuidelinesYour submission must include 3 columns:1) predicted outcome [ie. last 16 or better, quarter-finals or better,runner  or better], 2) country [using the country code], 3) Level of Certainty [0 no confidence, 100 certain]All submissions must be in CSV format. Use submission_template.csv to fill in your predictions. We have provided a default level of confidence in the submission template - if you are unsure about your level of confidence, then we recommend that you stick with our defaults.Note, you are predicting teams to finish in a particular position or better. So if you select Brazil to finish runner up or better, then you get points if Brazil finishes first or second. The level of confidence is used to weight selections for The Confidence Challenge (the higher the level of confidence the more points you get if you are correct, but the more you lose if you are incorrect). See the evaluation page for information on how submissions will be scored. Acceptable values1) All countries must be entered as three-character country codes. These codes are available in the 2010_country_codes.csv file below. 2) The confidence column must have values between 0 and 100. The file example_submission.csv shows you an sample submission.

    Traders, analysts, investors and hedge funds are always looking for techniques to
    better predict stock price movements. The 2010 INFORMS Data Mining Contest takes
    aim at this goal, requiring participants to build models that predict the movement
    of stock prices over the next 60 minutes.


    Knowing whether a stock will increase or decrease allows traders to make better
    investment decisions. Moreover, good predictive models allow traders to better understand
    what drives stock prices, supporting better risk management. The results of this
    contest could have a big impact on the finance industry.

    The INFORMS Data Mining Section (in conjunction with Sinapse) is pleased to announce
    its third annual data mining contest. This contest requires participants to develop
    a model that predicts stock price movements at five minute intervals.


    Competitors will be provided with intraday trading data showing stock price movements
    at five minute intervals, sectoral data, economic data, experts' predictions and
    indices. (We don’t reveal the underlying stock to prevent competitors from looking
    up the answers.)


    Being able to better predict short-term stock price movements would be a boon for
    high-frequency traders, so the methods developed in this contest could have a big
    impact on the finance industry.


    We have provided a training database to allow participants to build their predictive
    models. Participants will submit their predictions for the test database (which
    doesn't include the variable being predicted). The public leaderboard will be calculated
    based on 10 per cent of the test dataset.


    See methods/techniques used by the top three competitors 
        here.


    The winners of this contest will be honoured at a session of the INFORMS Annual
    Meeting in Austin-Texas (November 7-10).




Evaluationlinkkeyboard_arrow_upEntries will be evaluated according to the arithmetic mean of the AUC on the result database.The objective of the challenge is to predict whether the stock price will increase or decrease. Since this is a binary problem, the possible outcomes can be represented in a confusion matrix, where tp (true positive), fn (false negative), tn (true negative) and fp (false positive) represent all the possible outcomes:


 


Prediction




Class +1


Class 0




Truth


Class +1


Tp


Fn




Class 0


Fp


Tn



 Submissions can contain any real number, with larger values indicating higher confidence in positive class membership. We define the sensitivity (also called true positive rate or hit rate) and the specificity (true negative rate) as:Sensitivity = tp/posSpecificity = tn/negwhere pos=tp+fn is the total number of positive examples and neg=tn+fp the total number of negative examples.The results will be evaluated with the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC). This corresponds to the area under the curve - plotting sensitivity against specificity by varying a threshold on the prediction values to determine the classification result. The AUC is related to the area under the lift curve and the Gini index used in finance (Gini=2 AUC -1). The AUC is calculated using the trapezoid method.

The Confidence Challenge requires competitors to predict how far each country will progress through the World Cup and then assign a level of confidence to each prediction. A competitor's score is weighted by their level of confidence. There are more details on the submission instructions page and the evaluation page. The competition closes just before the first game kicks off on June 11th. What is your incentive to enter?The winner of this challenge wins $USD100 to bet on the winner of the FIFA Golden Ball award. Evaluationlinkkeyboard_arrow_upThe Confidence ChallengeThe results of this challenge are calculated based on a confidence-weighted score. For the confidence-weight score, a correct selection gives a competitor positive points and an incorrect prediction gives a competitor negative points. (The points are as in the table below.) The score a competitor receives from a particular selection is the confidence score multiplied by the points that the selection earns. So for example, if a competitor is 50 per cent confident that Brazil will win, they earn 3.47×0.5=1.73 if Brazil wins, but they lose 3.47×0.5=1.73 points if Brazil loses. If they are 75 per cent confident, they earn 3.47×0.75=2.6 if Brazil wins, and they lose 2.6 points if Brazil loses.

Note: in both challenges if teams earn equal scores, we will give a higher position to the competitor who submitted first (since they submitted when less information was available). Submission Instructionslinkkeyboard_arrow_upSubmission GuidelinesYour submission must include 3 columns:1) predicted outcome [ie. last 16 or better, quarter-finals or better,runner  or better], 2) country [using the country code], 3) Level of Certainty [0 no confidence, 100 certain]All submissions must be in CSV format. Use submission_template.csv to fill in your predictions. We have provided a default level of confidence in the submission template - if you are unsure about your level of confidence, then we recommend that you stick with our defaults.Note, you are predicting teams to finish in a particular position or better. So if you select Brazil to finish runner up or better, then you get points if Brazil finishes first or second. The level of confidence is used to weight selections for The Confidence Challenge (the higher the level of confidence the more points you get if you are correct, but the more you lose if you are incorrect). See the evaluation page for information on how submissions will be scored. Acceptable values1) All countries must be entered as three-character country codes. These codes are available in the 2010_country_codes.csv file below. 2) The confidence column must have values between 0 and 100. The file example_submission.csv shows you an sample submission.

In Australia, success rates have fallen to 20-25 per cent, meaning that most academics are spending valuable time making applications that end up being rejected. With this problem in mind, the University of Melbourne is hosting a competition to predict the success of grant applications. The winning model will be used by the university to predict which grant applications are likely to be successful, so that less time is wasted on applications that are unlikely to succeed. The university hopes the competition will also shed some light on what factors are important in determining whether an application will succeed. The university has provided a dataset containing 249 features, including variables that represent the size of the grant, the general area of study and de-identified information on the investigators who are applying for the grant. Participants train their models on 8,707 grant applications made between 2004 and 2008. They then make predictions on a further 2,176 applications made in 2009 and the first half of 2010.The winner of this competition will receive US$5,000. To be eligible for the prize, the winning method must be implementable by the University of Melbourne.  Evaluationlinkkeyboard_arrow_upTowards the end of the competition, teams will have the opportunity to 
nominate five entries. It is the best of these five entries that counts 
toward a team's final position. A team's last five entries will be 
chosen by default if they don't nominate any entries.
Entries
 will be evaluated using the area under the receiver operator curve 
(AUC). AUC was first used by the American army after the attack on Pearl
 Harbour, to detect Japanese aircraft from radar signals.Today, 
it is a commonly used evaluation method for binary choice problems, 
which involve classifying an instance as either positive or negative (success or not in this competition). 
Its main advantages over other evaluation methods, such as the simpler 
misclassification error, are:  It's insensitive to unbalanced datasets (datasets that have more installeds than not-installeds or vice versa).For
 other evaluation methods, a user has to choose a cut-off point above 
which the target variable is part of the positive class (e.g. a logistic
 regression model returns any real number between 0 and 1 - the modeler 
might decide that predictions greater than 0.5 mean a positive class 
prediction while a prediction of less than 0.5 mean a negative class 
prediction). AUC  evaluates entries at all cut-off points, giving better
 insight into how well the classifier is able to separate the two 
classes.Understanding AUCTo
 understand the calculation of AUC, a few basic concepts must be 
introduced. For a binary choice prediction, there are four possible 
outcomes:true positive - a positive instance that is correctly classified as positive;false positive - a negative instance that is incorrectly
 classified as positive;true negative - a negative instance that is correctly
 classified as negative;false negative - a positive instance that is incorrectly
 classified as negative;These possibilities can be neatly displayed in a confusion matrix:





actual class



 
P
N


predicted class
p
true positive
false positive


n
false negative
true negative


The true positive rate, or recall,  is calculated as the number of true positives divided by the total number of positives. When identifying aircraft from radar signals, it is the proportion  that are correctly identified.The false positive rate is calculated as the number of false positives divided by the total 
number of negatives. When identifying aircraft from radar signals, it is the rate of false alarms.If
 somebody makes random guesses, the ROC curve will be a diagonal line 
stretching from (0,0) to (1,1) - see the blue line in the figure below. 
To understand this consider: Somebody
 who randomly guesses that 10 per cent of all radar signals point to 
planes. The false positive rate and the false alarm rate will be 10 per 
cent. Somebody who randomly guesses that 90 per cent of 
all radar signals point to planes. The false positive rate and the false
 alarm rate will be 90 per cent.Meanwhile a perfect model will achieve a true positive rate of 1 and a false positive rate of 0. While
 ROC is a two-dimensional representation of a model's performance, the 
AUC distils this information into a single scalar. As the name implies, 
it is calculated as the area under the ROC curve. A perfect model will 
score an AUC of 1, while random guessing will score an AUC of around  of
 0.5. In practice, almost all models will fit somewhere in between.

6.0,6.0,2447,chess,Chess ratings - Elo versus the Rest of the World,This competition aims to discover whether other approaches can predict the outcome of chess games more accurately than the workhorse Elo rating system.,Featured,18,,08/03/2010 00:00:00,11/17/2010 20:00:00,,,,,True,True,False,True,20,0.0,RMSE,Root Mean Squared Error,Square root of the average of the squared errors.,False,2,2,20,False,False,USD,617.0,10,1.0,True,252,262,3228,,,False,False,,1,"Customlinkkeyboard_arrow_upWhen predicting the outcome of chess games, you typically need two things; a rating system wherein the current ability of each player is estimated based on past results, and a model for estimating the expected score for each player, once you know their ratings.Most rating systems use some methodology to determine initial ""seed"" ratings for the pool of players, and then update those ratings based on ongoing results.  The most famous approach is the Elo approach, where the applied change to a player's rating is proportional to the amount by which they exceed their aggregate expected score across all their recent games.  The scaling factor is known as the ""K-factor"", and for the official ratings used throughout the world, the K-factor is highest for new players and lowest for topmost players.  But there are many other approaches: the Ken Thompson approach takes each player's most recent 100 games and calculates the rating that would be most likely to lead to that performance.  The Mark Glickman approach is similar to Elo but introduces additional parameters for each player, tracking the level of confidence and level of volatility for each player's rating, and then using these parameters to determine which K-factor to apply.The initial seed ratings are typically determined through a simultaneous calculation: a start rating is assumed for each player, then a ""performance rating"" is calculated for each player based on their results and the ratings of their opponents, and then those performance ratings are fed back into another iteration as the start ratings.  This is allowed to run until it converges upon a stable set of ratings.  This was the methodology used to calculate initial ratings for most major rating systems.  In fact this is the overall approach taken by the Jeff Sonas Chessmetrics rating calculation, and is used not just to calculate initial ratings but in fact to calculate all ratings.There is a general convention in chess rating systems whereby the difference in two ratings is used for calculating expected score when two players face each other.  Of course it could just as well be the ratio of the two ratings, or some other more complex relationship that depends on the magnitude of the ratings and not just their relative difference.Here are some links to articles existing on rating systems:Elo and Ken ThompsonGlickoChessmetricsMicrosoft TrueSkillJeff Moser has a C# implementation of Elo and TrueSkill on Github.Jason Brownlee has posted a Java implementation of Glicko on Github.Customlinkkeyboard_arrow_upThis competition was organized by Jeff Sonas of Chessmetrics.Descriptionlinkkeyboard_arrow_upThe Elo rating system was invented half a century ago by Hungarian-born physicist and chess master Arpad Elo. It is the most famous technique for rating chess players and is used throughout the chess world. It has been applied to many other contests as well, including other board games, sports, and video games.  However, it has never really been demonstrated that the Elo approach to calculating chess ratings is superior.  Elo's formula was derived theoretically, in an era without large amounts of historical data or significant computing power.  With the benefit of powerful computers and large game databases, we can easily investigate approaches that might do better than Elo at predicting chess results.There are several alternatives to the Elo approach. Professor Mark Glickman developed the Glicko and Glicko-2 systems, which extend the Elo system by introducing additional parameters to represent the reliability and volatility of player ratings.  Ken Thompson uses a linearly weighted average of a player's last 100 results to calculate a weighted performance rating.  Jeff Sonas (who put together this competition) developed Chessmetrics ratings to maximize predictive power. More details are available on the hints page. We want to see if somebody out there can do even better.  Competitors train their rating systems using a training dataset of over 65,000 recent results for 8,631 top players. Participants then use their method to predict the outcome of a further 7,809 games.Along with  the opportunity to help shape the future of chess ratings, the top ten entries  win the following prizes (assuming they share their methodology). 1.

Update 2: Thanks to Chessbase, we've got some new prizes up for grabs. Update 18 October: Some of the rules of this competition have not been explcitly stated, notably that:1. participants are restricted to two entries per day;2. the public leaderboard is calculated based on 20 per cent of the test dataset. The final standings are calculated based on the remaining 80 per cent of the test dataset; and3. the final standings are calculated based on participants' best (rather than last) entry. The best entry is the entry that scores highest on the 80 per cent of the test dataset that is used to calculate the final standings (which may different from the best entry on the public leaderboard).Evaluationlinkkeyboard_arrow_upEntries are scored based on how accurately the entrant manages to predict the score per chess player per month. Entrants make predictions on individual games, and those predictions are then aggregated on a by chess player by month basis. An entry's score is the RMSE on chess players' expected monthly score.The scoring method is shown using example below. Table 1 - a sample by game dataset with three chess players, #1, #2 and #3:

The calculation is made in several steps. Step 1 - chess players' predicted scores and actual scores are summed by player by month. Notice that player #1 played two games in month 101 (see Table 1). So player #1 in month 101 (row 1 of Table 2) has a predicted score that is the sum of their predicted scores from both games (they were given a probability of 0.18 and 0.35 of winning each game, so the sum of their predicted scores is 0.53). Player #1 in month 101 (again row 1 of Table 2) has an actual score that is the sum of their actual scores from Table 1 (they won both games so the sum of their actual scores is 2).

Step 2 - the squared error (in column 5 of Table 2) is calculated as: (actual score - predicted score)^2. Step 3 - the root mean squared error (at the bottom of Table 2) is calculated as the square root of the the average squared error.

(R is opensource statistics software.),Featured,21,,10/10/2010 04:00:28,02/08/2011 09:00:00,,,,,True,True,False,True,62,0.0,AUC,Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve,"Measures discrimination. Calculates how well an algorithm separates true positives from false positives. Overall good metric for classification problems. Has range [0.5, 1.0]",True,2,5,20,False,False,USD,150.0,1,1.0,True,57,58,558,,,False,False,,1,"Customlinkkeyboard_arrow_upThere are many obvious ways you can try to improve on our example model. For example, you might try:Using nearest neighbor methods over both packages and users.Building a metric of maintainer quality and adding this predictor to the example logistic model.Incorporating out-degree information from the graphs we're providing. The example model only uses in-degree information.Using regularization to deal with the considerable correlation in the default predictors.Descriptionlinkkeyboard_arrow_upBeyond learning the basic syntax and idioms of a programming language, fluent programming requires the mastery of a large number of libraries that extend the functionality of the core language. For newcomers to a programming language, this poses a major challenge, as they must decide which libraries to invest their time into learning to use well. Given the sheer number of different libraries that are available for most popular programming languages and the considerable difficulty of determining their quality by simply inspecting their basic descriptions, this task can be a daunting one.We'd like you to build a library recommendation engine for R programmers, who usually refer to libraries as packages. We think that you can help neophyte R programmers by letting them know which packages are most likely to be installed by the average R user and what measurable properties of the packages themselves are able to predict this information. To train your algorithm, we're providing a data set that contains approximately 99,640 rows of data describing installation information for 1865 packages for 52 users of R. For each package, we've provided a variety of predictors derived from the rich metadata that is available for every R package. Your task is to model the behavior of the sample users for this training set of 1865 packages well enough that your predictions will generalize to a test data set, containing 33,125 rows. Using nothing more than simple data hacking, we think that you can radically improve upon the baseline model we're providing, which is a standard logistic regression that predicts the probability of a given package P being installed by a user U based on predictors derived from the package's metadata. But we are also providing you with a secondary data set that contains the unprocessed metadata, because we'd like to encourage you to dig deeper into the problem and use statistical analysis to find out what it is about a package that predicts whether it will be installed by the average user of a programming language. And, of course, particularly intrepid hackers can incorporate still more external information as the metadata we're using can be reproduced by spidering CRAN, the R package repository, directly and analyzing the raw source code for every existing R package.With that said, you are free to use whatever tools you wish, whether you prefer sophisticated modeling techniques or hacking metadata with regular expressions. We'll judge all contestants by their ability to predict whether a user U has package P installed. Whichever team achieves the highest AUC after four months on our test data set will win three UseR! books of their choosing.In order to be declared the winner of this contest, you must publicly release your final analysis code on GitHub as a fork of our example code. In addition, you will be required to document every step you've taken along the way. We're running this task to improve the lives of R programmers everywhere, so we'd like to make sure that any insights you discover are revealed to the entire world.This contest is being organized by the writers for Dataists, a new blog for data hackers.Update, 18 October: Towards the end of the competition, teams will have the opportunity to nominate five entries. It is the best of these five entries that counts toward a team's final position. A team's last five entries will be chosen by default if they don't nominate any entries.Evaluationlinkkeyboard_arrow_upEntries
 will be evaluated using the area under the receiver operator curve 
(AUC). AUC was first used by the American army after the attack on Pearl
 Harbour, to detect Japanese aircraft from radar signals.Today, 
it is a commonly used evaluation method for binary choose problems, 
which involve classifying an instance as either positive or negative (installed or not installed in this competitions). 
Its main advantages over other evaluation methods, such as the simpler 
misclassification error, are:  It's insensitive to unbalanced datasets (datasets that have more installeds than not-installeds or vice versa).For
 other evaluation methods, a user has to choose a cut-off point above 
which the target variable is part of the positive class (e.g. a logistic
 regression model returns any real number between 0 and 1 - the modeler 
might decide that predictions greater than 0.5 mean a positive class 
prediction while a prediction of less than 0.5 mean a negative class 
prediction). AUC  evaluates entries at all cut-off points, giving better
 insight into how well the classifier is able to separate the two 
classes.Understanding AUCTo
 understand the calculation of AUC, a few basic concepts must be 
introduced. For a binary choice prediction, there are four possible 
outcomes:true positive - a positive instance that is correctly classified as positive;false positive - a negative instance that is incorrectly
 classified as positive;true negative - a negative instance that is correctly
 classified as negative;false negative - a positive instance that is incorrectly
 classified as negative);These possibilities can be neatly displayed in a confusion matrix:





actual class



 
P
N


predicted class
p
true positive
false positive


n
false negative
true negative


The true positive rate, or recall,  is çalculated as the number of true positives divided by the total number of positives. When identifying aircraft from radar signals, it is proportion  that are correctly identified.The false positive rate is çalculated as the number of false positives divided by the total 
number of negatives. When identifying aircraft from radar signals, it is the rate of false alarms.If
 somebody makes random guesses, the ROC curve will be a diagonal line 
stretching from (0,0) to (1,1) - see the blue line in the figure below. 
To understand this consider: Somebody
 who randomly guesses that 10 per cent of all radar signals point to 
planes. The false positive rate and the false alarm rate will be 10 per 
cent. Somebody who randomly guesses that 90 per cent of 
all radar signals point to planes. The false positive rate and the false
 alarm rate will be 90 per cent.Meanwhile a perfect model will achieve a true positive rate of 1 and a false positive rate of 0. While
 ROC is a two-dimensional representation of a model's performance, the 
AUC distils this information into a single scalar. As the name implies, 
it is calculated as the area under the ROC curve. A perfect model will 
score an AUC of 1, while random guessing will score an AUC of around  of
 0.5. In practice, almost all models will fit somewhere in between. Ruleslinkkeyboard_arrow_up
