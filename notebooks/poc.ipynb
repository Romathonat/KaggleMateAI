And just as the Contest has launched the high-flying careers of its own performers - notably ABBA and Céline Dion - creating a strong model for this competition will land you a top ranking as a modeler on the Kaggle website.</div></div></div></div></div><div class=\"sc-jhJPuH lexbYk\" id=\"evaluation\"><div class=\"sc-dskThN cGppFq sc-ealCdV jZWWSy\"><div class=\"sc-cYRmzm SKQgu\"><div class=\"sc-jVIkER hIVbFL\" id=\"Evaluation\"><div class=\"sc-iHpopC bLEUds\"><h5 class=\"sc-brKeYL sc-ktEKTO izsmej JpJng\">Evaluation</h5></div><button aria-label=\"Copy link\" class=\"sc-ejdXBC jEohRd undefined google-material-icons\" title=\"Copy link\">link</button></div><button aria-label=\"Collapse \" class=\"sc-ejdXBC jEohRd undefined google-material-icons\" style=\"flex-shrink: 0;\" title=\"Collapse \">keyboard_arrow_up</button></div><div><div class=\"sc-SQxqA hAiBil\"><div class=\"sc-dlyeST hCUClb\"><p>Evaluation will be performed using the 'Absolute Error' method. A submission's absolute error is calculated by summing the absolute difference between predicted and actual votes.  A low score implies a small deviation of predicted votes from actual votes; a higher score implies a larger difference between predicted votes and actual votes.  The most accurate prediction has the lowest Absolute Error score.  <br/><br/>Here is an example of how 'Absolute Error' evaluation works:<br/><br/>Predicted voting (submitted by contestant X)<br/>                   France      Moldova     Norway<br/>France         0              1               1<br/>Moldova       2              0               2<br/>Norway        1              2               0</p>\n",

And just as the Contest has launched the high-flying careers of its own performers - notably ABBA and Céline Dion - creating a strong model for this competition will land you a top ranking as a modeler on the Kaggle website.Evaluationlinkkeyboard_arrow_upEvaluation will be performed using the \\'Absolute Error\\' method.\\xa0A submission\\'s absolute error is calculated by summing the absolute difference between predicted and actual votes.\\xa0 A low score implies a small deviation of predicted votes from actual votes; a higher score implies a larger difference between predicted votes and actual votes.\\xa0\\xa0The most accurate prediction has the lowest Absolute Error score.\\xa0 Here is an example of how \\'Absolute Error\\' evaluation works:Predicted voting (submitted by contestant X)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0France\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Moldova \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 NorwayFrance\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa00\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 1\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa01Moldova \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 2\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa02Norway\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 1\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 2\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa00\\nActual voting\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0France\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Moldova \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 NorwayFrance\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa00\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa01\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa02Moldova \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 1\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa00\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa01Norway\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa02\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa02\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa00 \\nContestant\\xa0X\\'s Absolute Error score,\\xa0working row-by-row, would be calculated as follows:\\xa0Absolute Error(X) = abs(0-0) + abs(1-1) + abs(2-1) + abs(1-2) + abs(0-0) + abs(1-2) + abs(2-1) + abs(2-2) + abs(0-0)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 = 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1+ 0 + 0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 = 4 Prizeslinkkeyboard_arrow_upThe Eurovision Song Contest 2010 forecasting competition will award a prize of US$1000 to the winning entrant.The prize money will only be awarded once the winner has sent a brief description of the methodology employed to generate his/her submission.Ruleslinkkeyboard_arrow_up\\nOne account per participant\\nYou cannot sign up to Kaggle from multiple accounts and therefore you cannot submit from multiple accounts.\\nNo private sharing outside teams\\n\\n        Privately sharing code or data outside of teams is not permitted.\\n        It\\'s okay to share code if made available to all participants on the forums.\\n    \\nTeam Mergers\\n\\n        Team mergers are allowed and can be performed by the team leader.

The countries listed in row one are the voting countries. Only 25 of these 39 competing (column one) countries will progress from the semi-finals to the final, however each voting country listed in (row one) will vote in the final.\\xa0 Your task effectively involves  two steps:1. Firstly you must predict which 25 countries will make it to the final. Keep in mind that\\xa0Spain, United\\nKingdom, France, Germany and Norway\\xa0are guaranteed final competitors.2. Once you have chosen your 25 finalists you must predict the voting (ie who will vote for who). Make sure you only allocate votes to the 25 countries you predict will make the final. Submissions will only be accepted if each voting country (in row one) has allocated all its votes once to the potential final competitors (in column one), ie:\\xa0the scores of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12 have been allocated exactly once per voting country.Submissions with scores other than 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10 or 12 will not be accepted.Submissions will only be accepted if votes are allocated to ≤ 25 countries.\\xa0 Submissions with votes allocated to > 25 countries will not be accepted. Note: all 39 countries vote regardless of whether or not they make the final. Each\\xa0contestant may only enter with one submission. However, a contestant can delete and replace their submission at any time up until the competition\\'s deadline. As exemplified by the example submission, please ensure that there are no blank cells; instead, where no vote is allocated, enter a \\'0\\'.Note: you can open CSV files with Microsoft Excel or OpenOffice for more human-friendly viewing.

       "<div class=\"sc-dlyeST hCUClb\"><p>Hello everyone, first of all, I'd like to mention that this is my first Kaggle competition at the global level. Although I consider myself a novice in this field, I have been actively involved in Data Science/Machine Learning Engineering for about a year, and I knew I was good at it. So, being the second in my first competition made me really happy.</p>\n",
       "<p>Soon, I will share my approach and notebook on this Discord channel : <a href=\"https://discord.gg/WpGhjsz8pn\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/WpGhjsz8pn</a></p>\n",
       "<p>For now, let me briefly explain my approach:</p>\n",
       "<p>1) First and foremost, I heavily relied on using the class structure and conducted numerous trial and error experiments. I tried almost everything, such as testing different encoders to see which one provides better results, deciding which features to add, and determining which approaches yield better outcomes. I tried various things by adopting an open-close approach. The images below showcase some of my experiments.</p>\n",
       "<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-forum-message-attachments/o/inbox%2F11213462%2F17116047177df9bad134c4d40d8fb948%2Fclass.png?generation=1686657891197870&amp;alt=media\"/></p>\n",
       "<p>2) I experimented with a lot of feature engineering techniques, and I cannot individually mention which ones were beneficial or not. However, I will briefly discuss the most important one: I performed a fitting process on the training data to align it with the test data we would encounter. We observed that if there are no outliers in the test data, there are no crabs above the age of 20 or below the age of 4. So, why should we use data for crabs aged 20 and above or 4 and below when training our models? Based on this line of thinking, I decided to build a more accurate model specifically for the test data and removed entries in the training data where the age was greater than 21 or less than 3 (leaving a margin of 1 or 2 years resulted in better results).<br/>\n",
       "The logic I developed at the top had the most significant impact on the success of my model.</p>\n",
       "<p>3) Another significant factor was, of course, the synthetic data creation model shared at the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/code/inversion/make-synthetic-crab-age-data\" target=\"_blank\">address</a> This model helped me align the test data to be suitable for 5-fold validation. Since we had 56k test samples and planned to use 5 folds, and one-fifth of my available training data would be used for validation, I aimed to keep the number of validation and test samples similar or equal. I first generated around 200k data points using this model. Additionally, the competition provided approximately 74k training samples. As a result, I ended up with a training dataset of around 274k samples. By using this dataset in 5 folds, each fold had approximately 55 samples, which is close to the number of samples in the test data. This approach aimed to increase the correlation between CV and LB scores.</p>\n",
       "<p>4) For the model approach, I found the best parameters for the desired algorithms using Optuna in a separate notebook. Then, in the original notebook, I built models using these parameters and performed ensembling.</p>\n",
       "<p>5) I used XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, and HGBR - a total of 4 models. Although using Gradient Boosting slightly increased the CV score, I didn't include it due to the significant time investment and reduced experimentation opportunities.</p>\n",
       "<p>These are the general outlines of my approach. Of course, there is much more, but as I mentioned before, I will share all the details and the notebook on this Discord channel : <a href=\"https://discord.gg/WpGhjsz8pn\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/WpGhjsz8pn</a></p>\n",
       "<p>I hope you find it useful. If you did, I would appreciate an upvote :)</p>\n",
       "<p>Thank you!</p></div>"
